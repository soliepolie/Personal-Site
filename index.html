  <!-- ***DISPLAY***
        paragraph elements: <p> are default blocking display elements
        span elements: <span> are default inline display elements(just like image and
        anchor tags, show up next to each other and don't block elements from
        showing up on the line next to them) only take up as much space as it
        needs to be but can't change the width
        Display property: we can change this in any element. Different types
        include inline, block, and inline-block
        display: inline-block; will be displayed as inline elements and you can change
        the width
        display:none; will take it out of page as if never existed
        visibility: hidden; will hide element but keep it's space as if it is still
        there
      ***POSITION***
        static position: all HTML elements are static by default, go along with
        HTML rules
        relative position: (position: relative; left: 30px; this would place a
        margin 30px from the left side of the element so that would move it to
        the right) position element relative to how it would have been
        positioned had it been static. This DOES NOT MOVE OTHER ELEMENTS.
        absolute position: (position: absolute; right: 30px; this would move
        element 30px to the right from the parent container, the parent container
        can be the body of the page or a container that the elemnt is placed in)
        using absolute position DOES EFFECT OTHER ELEMENTS AROUND IT.
        fixed position: (position: fixed; top: 0; if your page scrolls, this
        would keep the element fixed to where ever you specified the location)
